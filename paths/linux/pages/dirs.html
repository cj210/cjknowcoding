            <h3>I have learnt Linux from
                <em>Mr. Colt steele</em>
                through his awesome course on Udemy - The linux command line bootcamp: Beginner to power user.</h3>
            <p>As the course's title emphasises, the course helps the learner to understand the basics and apply the knowledge using GNU/Linux as their everyday operating system. In this Tutorials, I'm only including the basic concepts and the course has much more than the content presented in this Tutorials.</p>
            <p>This Tutorials is just a personal practice but still have the content necessary for readers to get started with GNU/Linux.</p>
