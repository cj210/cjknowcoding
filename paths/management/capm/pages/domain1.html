                Projects can initiate operations and viceversa. Lets consider
                construction of a manufacturing plant. It is a project and the
                end result is a unique manufacturing plant that is used to
                manufacture different products. The manufacture of products
                involve operations. Thus project has lead to operations. Now,
                for instance, if the sale of the manufactured product is low,
                then to increase sales, online presence is required. Then a new
                project will be initiated to deliver a website to take orders
                online. Thus operations have lead to initiation of a project.

        The content present on this site is more like my personal notes that I
        have prepared for CAPM certification exam. Since I have prepare from the
        mentioned course, most of the content would be similar in presentation.
        So, I acknowledge the original creator to be Mr. Joseph Phillips and I'm
        only a student of his.
