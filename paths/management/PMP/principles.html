        <h3>Performance Domains:</h3>
        <p>
          Domains are a group of related activities that are critical for the
          effective delivery of project outcomes.They are interactive,
          interrelated, and interdependent areas of focus that work in unison to
          achieve desired project outcomes. They operate as an integrated
          system, with each domain being interdependent of the other domains to
          enable successful delivery of the project and its intended outcomes.
          The specific activities undertaken within each of the performance
          domains are determined by the context of the organization, the
          project, deliverables, the project team, stakeholders, and other
          factors.
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/domains.png" alt="Principles and Domains" />
        <ol>
          <li>Stakeholders performace domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Identify the stakeholders throughout the project, understand and
            analyse their requirements, values and beliefs, prioritise the
            stakeholders, engage with the stakeholders at required level and
            then monitor the stakeholders.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Team performance domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with the people who
            are responsible for creating project deliverables that realize
            business outcomes. This performance domain entails establishing the
            culture and environment that enables a collection of diverse
            individuals to evolve into a high-performing project team.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Development approach and lifecycle performance domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with the development
            approach, cadence, and life cycle phases of the project.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Planning performace domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with the initial,
            ongoing, and evolving organization and coordination necessary for
            delivering project deliverables and outcomes. The purpose of
            planning is to proactively develop an approach to create the project
            deliverables.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Project work performace domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with establishing
            project processes, managing physical resources, and fostering a
            learning environment. Project work is connected with establishing
            the processes and performing the work done by the project team to
            deliver the expected deliverables and outcomes.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Project delivery performance domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with delivering the
            scope and quality that the project was undertaken to achieve.
            Project delivery is about meeting requirements, scope, and quality
            expectations to produce the expected deliverable.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Measurement Performance Domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with assessing
            project performance and taking appropriate actions to maintain
            acceptable performance. Involves measuring project performance and
            implementing appropriate responses to keep the project on track.
            This domain evaluates the amount to which the work done in the
            Delivery Performance Domain is meeting the metrics identified in the
            Planning Performance Domain.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Uncertainty Performance Domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with risk and
            uncertainty. Projects happen in environments with varying degrees of
            uncertainty. Uncertainty in the broadest sense is a state of not
            knowing or unpredictability. Uncertainty presents threats and
            opportunities that project teams explore, assess, and decide how to
            handle.

        <h4>Organisational Process Assets OPA:</h4>
        <p>
          Organizations have assets such as information, policies, procedures,
          documents, or knowledge bases which are called Organizational Process
          Assets (OPA) to help them in achieving their objectives. These are
          generally provided by PMO and kept in some central repository so that
          they can be used whenever required. Project team members update and
          add to the Organizational Process Assets throughout the project.
          Following are the examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project templates</li>
          <li>Software tools</li>
          <li>Historic information</li>
          <li>Project closure guidelines</li>
          <li>Risk control procedures</li>
          <li>Change control procedures</li>
          <li>Issue and defect management procedures</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Project documents:</h4>
        <p>
          Project documents are additional documents that are created and used
          throughout the 49 processes that are not part of the project
          management plan. These can be any documents that are related to the
          project.
        </p>
        <h4>Project management plan:</h4>
        <p>
          Defines how the project is executed, monitored and controlled, and
          closed.
        </p>
        <h4>Expert judgement:</h4>
        <p>
          Includes hiring an expert or subject matter expert (SME) to help you
          to plan a process or conduct a process
        </p>
        <h4>
          Data Gathering, Data Analysis, Data Representation, Decision Making:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Gthering: </strong>On certain processes, you will need
            to gather additional data before coming up with an output for that
            process. Gather data about a particular process that you’re working
            on by using methods like brainstorming, interviews, focus groups,
            checklist, questionnaires and surveys etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Analysis: </strong>To analyze the data that has been
            gathered using methods alternative analysis, root cause analysis,
            varience analysis, trend analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Representation: </strong>Illustrate different ways that
            a data could be shown to stakeholders using flowcharts, fishbone
            diagrams, histograms etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision Making: </strong>Have to make a decision on what to
            do with the data using methods like voting, multicriteria decision
            analysis, autocratic decision making etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Interpersonal and Team Skills:</h4>
        <p>
          All project managers need to have good interpersonal and team skills
          in order to manage the different stakeholders that will be on the
          project. These include active listening, conflict management,
          facilitation, meeting management etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Meetings:</h4>
        <p>
          Meetings can be done face-to-face or virtually. Meetings need to have
          an agenda and should be distributed to all the attendees before the
          meeting. Meetings must be timed, including having set start and finish
          times for topics and the entire meeting. Meeting always stays on topic
          and does not go off topic and all attendees have to input to the
          topics. Minutes of meetings must be distributed once the meeting is
          done.
        </p>
        <h4>Project Management Information System (PMIS):</h4>
        <p>
          Automated system that is used to help the project manager optimize the
          schedule or keep track of all the documents and the deliverables. This
          include all the software and hardware tools that we need to manage the
          project from start to finish.
        </p>
        <h4>Change request:</h4>
        <p>
          Proposal to change a document, deliverable, or baseline.This can
          include a request to add or remove work from the scope, finish the
          project faster, or complete the project more cheaply. This can be done
          by corrective actions, preventive actions or defect repair.
        </p>
        <h4>Work Performance Data, Information, Report:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Work performance data: </strong>The raw data</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Work performace information</strong>Information of the work
            that was performed compared to the plan

          <li>
            <strong>Work Performance Report: </strong>overall status report of
            the actual project
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            >You take the work performance data and compare it against the plan
            to come up with the work performance information. Then you take all
            the work performance information and create the work performance
            reports. In short, data feeds info and all the info creates
            reports.</em

        <h3>Random points:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A regulation is an official guideline that must be followed by the
            project, usually imposed by local or national law. A standard is a
            guideline that should be followed, but is not mandatory. A baseline
            is used to measure the performance of the project, such as cost,
            schedule, and scope. A system is a set of processes and procedures
            that a company will implement to manage something, such as
            accounting procedures to invoice customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            A laissez-faire approach is when the project manager allows the team
            to make their own decisions and set their own goals. This is usually
            known as a hands-off style. “Charismatic” is inspirational,
            “transactional” focuses on goals and feedback, and
            “transformational” encourages innovation.
          </li>
          <li>
            A phase gate is done at the end of a phase, deciding whether to
            continue to the next phase or not. A kickoff meeting is generally
            done at the end of planning and sometimes at the end of the
            project’s initiated sections in order to start the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a project is completed, the project stakeholders should conduct
            a phase gate or phase review to determine whether to continue the
            project or end it. You should not start a phase if you have not
            reviewed the previously finished phase. Archive project records
            would have been done in the phase that was just completed. A kickoff
            meeting is used at the end of the planning or initiating a section
            of the project in order to start the next section.
