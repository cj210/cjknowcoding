        <h3>Performance Domains:</h3>
        <p>
          Domains are a group of related activities that are critical for the
          effective delivery of project outcomes.They are interactive,
          interrelated, and interdependent areas of focus that work in unison to
          achieve desired project outcomes. They operate as an integrated
          system, with each domain being interdependent of the other domains to
          enable successful delivery of the project and its intended outcomes.
          The specific activities undertaken within each of the performance
          domains are determined by the context of the organization, the
          project, deliverables, the project team, stakeholders, and other
          factors.

            individuals to evolve into a high-performing project team.

            approach, cadence, and life cycle phases of the project.

            ongoing, and evolving organization and coordination necessary for
            delivering project deliverables and outcomes. The purpose of
            planning is to proactively develop an approach to create the project
            deliverables.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Project work performace domain:</li>
          <blockquote>

            the processes and performing the work done by the project team to
            deliver the expected deliverables and outcomes.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Project delivery performance domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with delivering the
            scope and quality that the project was undertaken to achieve.
            Project delivery is about meeting requirements, scope, and quality
            expectations to produce the expected deliverable.

            Delivery Performance Domain is meeting the metrics identified in the
            Planning Performance Domain.
          </blockquote>
          <li>Uncertainty Performance Domain:</li>
          <blockquote>
            Deals with activities and functions associated with risk and
            uncertainty. Projects happen in environments with varying degrees of
            uncertainty. Uncertainty in the broadest sense is a state of not
            knowing or unpredictability. Uncertainty presents threats and
            opportunities that project teams explore, assess, and decide how to
            handle.
