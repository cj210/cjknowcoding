        <h3>What is Java Script?</h3>
        <p>
          Java Script is a High-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, multi
          paradigm programming language. Now lets see what the terms in that

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Object-oriented</strong>:Based on objects for store most
            kind of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multi-Paradigm</strong>: We can use different styles of
            structuring for our code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Programming</strong>: Instruct computer to

        <h3>What is the role of JS in web develpment?</h3>
        <p>
          The modern web pages are a result of HTML, CSS and Java Script. Their
          roles can be explained as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML - <em>The Noun</em></strong
            >: Html is the basic building blocks of a web page which has all the
            content like the paragraphs, images etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS - <em>The Adjective</em></strong
            >: CSS is how the content is presented. Its the basic style of the
            web page
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JS - <em>The Verb</em></strong
            >: This adds the dynamic and interactive effects to the web page and
            manupulates the content of CSS. The real programming language of the
            web.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="declaration">
        <h3>How is it used?</h3>
        <body>JavaScript can be declared with the 
            &ltscript&gt&lt/script&gt tag in an HTML file. All the code goes into the tag. Alternatively, we can use a seperate file, .js file, and add it to the HTML file with <em>src</em> attribute of an empty &ltscript&gt&lt/script&gt tag. In general this tag is added just above the closing body tag &lt/body&gt

        Everything I have learnt about Java Script is from
        <em>Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann</em>
      </h3>
      <p>
        He is an awesome teacher and one of <em>The Best Gurus</em> of web
        development
      </p>
      <p>
        Im <strong>greatly</strong> thankful to him for his wonderful course on
        Udemy - The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!.
        Since, I learnt from his teachings, many of the wordings here would
        resemble his teachings. So, I give credits to him and I strongly state
        that this practice work of mine wouldnot be an example of my learning
        experience. I still have a long way of practice to go &#128540;
